Graphs are of 2 types 
-> Directed : Edge has some direction i.e 2 -> 3 means there is edge from 2 to 3 but not from 3 -> 2
-> Undirected : Edge has no direction i.e 2 -> 3 means there is edge from 2 to 3 and also from 3 -> 2


Graphs can be made in c++ in 2 ways 
 -> Adjacency List  
 -> Adjacency Matrix
