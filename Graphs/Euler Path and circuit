Path -> Route along the edges that start at a vertex and may or may not end at 
same vertex
Circuit -> Route along the edges that start and end at same vertex

Euler path -> It traverse every edge of graph exactly once
Euler Circuit -> It traverse every edge of graph exactly once

A graph is called Eulerian if it has an Eulerian Cycle and called Semi-Eulerian 
if it has an Eulerian Path.
To find if graph is Eulerian or not we can see following condition : 

-> Undirected graph 
  * For this graph to have eulerian circuit all the nodes should have even degree.
  * For this graph to have eulerian path all nodes should have even degree or 
  exactly one node has odd degree.

  -> Directed graph
  * For this graph to have eulerian circuit every vertex should have equal 
  indegree and outdegree.
  * For this graph to have eulerian path atmost one node should have (in - out) 
  degree = 1 and atmost one node should have (out - in) = 1 and all other nodes 
  should have equal in and out degree.

   Also graph should be connected.
