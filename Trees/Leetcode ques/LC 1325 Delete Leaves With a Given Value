Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).

Code :
TreeNode* solve(TreeNode *root, int target){
        if(root == NULL)
            return NULL;
        
        root->left = solve(root->left, target);
        root->right = solve(root->right, target);
        
        if(root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL && root->val == target)
            return NULL;
        
        return root;
    }
    
    
TreeNode* removeLeafNodes(TreeNode* root, int target) {
        return solve(root, target);
}
