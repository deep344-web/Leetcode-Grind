Problem statement :
Given a sorted array and a value x, the ceiling of x is the smallest element in 
array greater than or equal to x, and the floor is the greatest element smaller 
than or equal to x. Assume than the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. Write
cefficient functions to find floor and ceiling of x. 

Code : 
int findFloor(long long int arr[], int N, long long int K) {
    
     int low = 0, high = N-1, res = -1;
     
     while(low <= high){
         int mid = low + (high - low)/2;
         
         if(arr[mid] <= K){
             res = mid;
             low = mid+1;
         }
         
         else
         {
             high = mid-1;
         }
     }
     
     return res;
}


int findCeil(long long int arr[], int N, long long int K) {
    
     int low = 0, high = N-1, res = -1;
     
     while(low <= high){
         int mid = low + (high - low)/2;
         
         if(arr[mid] >= K){
             res = mid;
             high = mid-1;
         }
         
         else
         {
             low = mid+1;
         }
     }
     
     return res;
}
