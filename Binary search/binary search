* Binary search is searching algo which works in O(logn) time complexity given the 
elements in array are sorted. 

* Binary search can be applied on problems where the arrays are sorted.
* It can also be applied on problems where the answer is monotonically increasing
and decreasing even though the array given is not sorted.

Pseudo code for binary search :)
//array sorted in ascending order
int BinarySearch(int *arr, int n, int ele){
    int l = 0, r = n-1;

     while(l <= r){
         int mid = l + (r-l)/2;

         if(arr[mid] == ele)
         return mid;

         else if(arr[mid] > ele)
         {
             high = mid-1;
         }

         else
            low = mid+1;
     }

     return -1;

}


//array sorted in descending order
int BinarySearch(int *arr, int n, int ele){
    int l = 0, r = n-1;

     while(l <= r){
         int mid = l + (r-l)/2;

         if(arr[mid] == ele)
         return mid;

         else if(arr[mid] > ele)
         {
             low = mid+1;
         }

         else
            high = mid-1;
     }

     return -1;

}
