Problem statement : 
Given an array arr of n elements which is first increasing and then may be 
decreasing, find the maximum element in the array.
Note: If the array is increasing then just print then last element will be the 
maximum value.

Code : 
	int findMaximum(int arr[], int n) {
	    int low = 0, high = n-1;
	    while(low <= high){
	        int mid = low + (high - low)/2;
	        
	        int prev = mid > 0 ? arr[mid-1] : INT_MIN;
	        int next = mid < n-1 ? arr[mid+1] : INT_MIN;
	        
	        if(arr[mid] > prev && arr[mid] > next)
	        return arr[mid];
	        
	        else if(prev > arr[mid])
	        {
	            high = mid-1;
	        }
	        
	        else
	        low = mid+1;
	        
	    }
	    
	    
	    return 0;
	}
