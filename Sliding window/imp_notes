Type of problems
-> subarray / substring 
-> window size given like k
-> repeated calculations in array or string is happening

There are 2 types of sliding windows :
 * Fixed sized : In this we are given k or window size
 * Variable sized : Here most of times we are asked to find max or min window size or indices of valid windows.

 Some problems for understanding the concept
 - Fixed size window
 * Max/ Min subarray of size of k
 * Ist -ve element in every window of size k
 * Count occurences of given pattern in the given string
 * maximum of every subarray of size k
  
- Variable size window
* Largest/smallest subarray of sum k
* Largest substring having k distinct characters
* Length of largest substring having no repeating characters
* Minimum window substring having all the characters of the given pattern.
