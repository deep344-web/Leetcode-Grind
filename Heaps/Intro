Heaps are mostly used to solve problems that can be solved by sorting. 
* If we are asked to find largest element kind of problem then use - Min Heap
* If we are asked to find smallest element kind of problem then use - Max Heap

Heap can be formed in c++ using priority_queue class of STL

syntax for max heap
priority_queue<int> pq;

syntax for min heap
priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
