Problem statement :
A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. If you go to a party of N people, find if there is a celebrity in the party or not.
A square NxN matrix M[][] is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j  is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. Here M[i][i] will always be 0.

Code :
 int celebrity(vector<vector<int> >& M, int n) 
    {
         int i = 0 , j= n-1;
         while(i < j)
         {
             if(M[i][j] == 1)
             i++;
             else
             j--;
             
        }
        if(i > j)
        i = i-1;
        
        for(int k=0 ; k<n ; k++)
        {
            if(k != i && (M[k][i] == 0 || M[i][k] == 1))
            return -1;
        }
        return i;
    }
