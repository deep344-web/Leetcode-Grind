Find power of a number in log N time.
For example we need to find a ^ n, so going with brute force approach the time complexity will be O(N) time.  Here we will use an efficient approach to solve this. Suppose we need to find 4^6, it is similar to finding 16^ 3. so when we have even powers we reduce the multiplications to half. Now let us take example of odd powers, for ex : 4^7 then we can get answer as 4 * (16 ^ 3).

So same concept is used here.

int power(int a, int b){
    int res = 1;
    while(b)
    {
        if(b % 2){
            res *= a;
            b -= 1;
        }

        else
        {
            a = a*a;
            b = b/2;
        }

    }

    return res;
}
