To check if number N is prime or not we can iterate over all the numbers upto N and see if any number divides N then it is not prime.

                                                                                    TC : O(N)

                                                                                             we can reduce this complexity by iterating till
                                                                                             sqrt(N) because all the no.s dividing N will come in pairs like for 12 factors are (1, 12) (3, 4) (2, 6)  so here when we are checking for 2 we can also check for 6 at same time. This will reduce the complexity.

bool CheckPrime(int N)
{
    if (N == 1)
        return false;

    for (int i = 2; i * i <= N; i++)
    {
        if (N % i == 0)
            return false;
    }

    return true;
}
