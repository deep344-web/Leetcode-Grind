Euclid Algorithm or GCD(Greatest common divisor)

Points to remember : 
*  GCD(A, B) =  GCD(B, A)
*  GCD(A, 0) = GCD(0, A) = A
*  GCD(A, B) = GCD(A-B, B) = GCD(A, B-A)

int func(int a, int b){
    if(b == 0)
    return a;

    return gcd(b, a%b);
}


Extended Euclid Algorithm
To solve the following eqn we use this algorithm. 
                ax + by = GCD(a, b)
